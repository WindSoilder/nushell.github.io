# Nushell 0.76

Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your command line. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful command line pipelines.

Today, we're releasing version 0.76 of Nu. This release also contains a good amount of polish and refactoring behind the scenes.

# Where to get it

Nu 0.76 is available as [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0.76.0) or from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nu). If you have Rust installed you can install it using `cargo install nu`.

NOTE: The optional dataframe functionality is available by `cargo install nu --features=dataframe`.

As part of this release, we also publish a set of optional plugins you can install and use with Nu. To install, use `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin name>`.

# Breaking changes

- `load-env` can not accidentally set `$env.PWD` anymore ([#7963](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7963))
- The `--numbered` flag to enumerate entries has been removed from `each`, `par-each`, `each while`, and `reduce`. Use the `enumerate` command added in 0.75 instead. ([#7777](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/7777))
